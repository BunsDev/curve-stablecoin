Functions
---------

.. function:: transferFrom(_from: address, _to: address, _value: uint256) -> bool

    Transfer tokens between two accounts using a previously granted approval from the
    originating account to the caller.

    :param address _from: The account tokens will originate from.
    :param address _to: The account to credit tokens to.
    :param uint256 _value: The amount of tokens to transfer.
    :returns: ``True`` iff the function is successful.
    :rtype: bool
    :reverts: If the caller has an insufficient allowance granted by the originating account.
    :reverts: If the receiving account is either the zero address, or the token contract itself.
    :reverts: If the originating account has an insufficient balance.
    :log: :class:`Approval` - iff the caller's allowance is less than ``MAX_UINT256``.
    :log: :class:`Transfer`

.. function:: transfer(_to: address, _value: uint256) -> bool

    Transfer tokens from the caller to another account.

    :param address _to: The account to credit tokens to.

    :returns: ``True`` iff the function is successful.
    :rtype: bool

    :log: :class:`Transfer`

.. function:: approve(_spender: address, _value: uint256) -> bool

    Allow an account to transfer up to ``_value`` amount of the caller's tokens.

    .. note::

        This function is suceptible to front running as described `here <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729>`_.
        Use the :func:`increaseAllowance` and :func:`decreaseAllowance` functions to mitigate the described race condition.

    :param uint256 _value: The total allowance amount.
    :returns: ``True`` iff the function is successful.
    :rtype: bool

    :param address _owner: The account granting an approval and which generated the signature provided.
    :param address _spender: The account the allowance is granted to.
    :param uint256 _value: The total allowance amount.
    :param uint256 _deadline: The timestamp after which the signature is considered invalid.

    :param bytes32 _r: The first 32 byte chunk of the generated signature.

    :rtype: bool
    :reverts: If the ``_owner`` argument is the zero address.

    :reverts: If the recovered signer is not equivalent to the ``_owner`` argument.
    :log: :class:`Approval`

.. function:: increaseAllowance(_spender: address, _add_value: uint256) -> bool

    :param address _spender: The account to increase the allowance of.
    :param uint256 _add_value: The amount to increase the allowance by.
    :returns: ``True`` iff the function is successful.

.. function:: decreaseAllowance(_spender: address, _sub_value: uint256) -> bool

    Decrease the allowance granted to ``_spender`` by the caller.

    :param uint256 _value: The amount of tokens to burn.
    :returns: ``True`` iff the function is successful.
    :rtype: bool
    :reverts: If the caller has an insufficient allowance.
    :reverts: If the account tokens are to be burned from has an insufficient balance.
